# Verificador-CPF
Projeto em React de um verificador dos últimos 2 dígitos do CPF. (Cadastro Pessoa Física)
///
React project that checks the last 2 digits of the CPF (Individual Taxpayer Registry) 
I used VITE with Typescript to code it.
The css is almost default from VITE, because the focus was to make it functional and not pretty.
Im starting to learn more about tailwind Css and i intend to make a project using it with React.
