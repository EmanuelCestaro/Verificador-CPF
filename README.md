I used VITE with Typescript to code it.
The CSS is almost default from VITE, because the focus was to make it functional and not pretty.
Im starting to learn more about tailwind Css and i intend to make a project using it with React.

The CPF has 11 numbers, last two digits are verifying digits
The fist verifier is the result of (multiplying the first nine digits of the CPF by a descending sequence of weights), then adding it all together,(and the rest of dividing by 11) then subtracting 11 by it...
The second one...........
Its kinda complex...
